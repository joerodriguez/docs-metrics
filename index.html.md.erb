The Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg; (PCF) Metrics tile stores metrics data from applications running on PCF and graphically presents that data for operators and developers. PCF Metrics helps operators and developers better understand the health and performance of their apps by providing a near real-time view of the following data:

* Container metrics: CPU, memory, and disk percentages (updated every 30 seconds)
* Network metrics: requests per second, HTTP errors per second, and request latency (updated every second)
* App events: create, update, start, stop, and crash (updated as they happen)
